I am a developmental psychologist studying early cognitive and social processes, with a particular interest in the mind-body problem within social contexts - examining how social cognition interfaces with physical states of the body/brain. 
<br> 
I received my PhD from the University of British Columbia in 2021, focusing on the neurophysiological processes underlying infants’ responses to social interactions (e.g., helping/hindering). Following this, I completed a postdoctoral program at the University of Maryland, investigating the developmental roots of social anxiety and the links between early brain activity and cognitive functioning. 
<br>
Currently, at the IMM Lab, my research examines how social interactions and speech are represented in the infant brain using magnetoencephalography (MEG).
